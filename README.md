# Data Engineering Zoomcamp project - Week 2

This is Week 2: Workflow Orchestration with Mage.AI from Data Engineering Zoomcamp organised by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/blog/data-engineering-zoomcamp.html)

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data.

We learned how to use the Mage platform. This was covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).
